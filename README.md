# FileSystem
File System (Not an OS)

This menu driven program was created for an Operating Systems class, where we were given specific directions.

The first time the word "create" is entered, the first text file must be stored in a root directory called "ROOTDIR."
The second time the word "create" is entered, a sub-directory called "SUB" is created inside of "ROOTDIR." A second text file is stored in the sub-directory.
The second time the word "create" is entered, a sub-directory called "SUB1" is created and inside of that is sub-direcotry called "SUB2." The third text file is stored in "SUB2."
